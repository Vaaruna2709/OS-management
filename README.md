# C Programs: Deadlock Detection and Scheduling Algorithms

## Introduction

This repository contains two C programs:

1. **deadlock.c**: A program to detect deadlocks in a system.
2. **scheduling.c**: A program to calculate turnaround time and average waiting time for a set of processes.

## Prerequisites

To compile and run these programs, you will need:

- MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) for compiling C programs.

## Files

- `deadlock.c`: A C program that detects deadlocks in a system.
- `scheduling.c`: A C program that calculates the turnaround time and average waiting time for processes using scheduling algorithms.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and instructions on how to compile and run the programs.

## Compilation and Running with MinGW

1. Install MinGW if not already installed. You can download it from [MinGW website](http://www.mingw.org/).

2. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.

3. Navigate to the directory containing the programs.

### Compiling `deadlock.c` and 'scheduling.c`

```sh
gcc deadlock.c -o deadlock

gcc scheduling.c -o scheduling
